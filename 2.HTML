  <h3>STARTING FROM ZERO</h3>
  J. David Eisenberg has written a useful How to Read W3C Specs for web designers. If reading technical specifications
  isn't part of your daily fare, I recommend starting with that.
  Also, if you are totally clueless about CSS, I recommend you first learn what it is and how to use it. For a ver
  y brief tutorial, you can start with the Introduction to CSS 2.1. For a fuller, friendlier introduction, pick up a
   learning CSS book that focuses on CSS fundamentals rather than on design. Play with CSS in a text editor. Design a few mock homepages
  <li> . Get introduced to selector specificity and margin collapsing. Add * { border: 1px dashed gray; } to a web page so you can see the box model</li>
   <li>. Having an idea of where this is all headed will help you fit together all the dry technicalities in the specifications.</li>
